## Rafiki

Rafiki is an open source package that exposes a comprehensive set of
Interledger APIs. It's intended to be run by wallet providers, allowing them to
offer Interledger functionality to their users.

Rafiki is made up of several components including an Interledger connector, a
high-throughput accounting database, and an API which can be accessed directly
by users to implement Interledger applications.

Rafiki also allows for delegated access, offering OAuth-based flows to grant
third-party applications access to Interledger functionality on a user's
account.
