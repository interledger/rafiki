## What is Rafiki?

Rafiki is open source software that provides an efficient solution for an [account servicing entity](https://rafiki.dev/resources/glossary#account-servicing-entity-ase) to enable Interledger functionality on its users' accounts.

This includes

- sending and receiving payments (via [SPSP](https://rafiki.dev/resources/glossary#simple-payment-setup-protocol-spsp) and [Open Payments](https://rafiki.dev/overview/concepts/open-payments))
- allowing third-party access to initiate payments and view transaction data (via [Open Payments](https://rafiki.dev/overview/concepts/open-payments))

**❗ Rafiki is intended to be run by account servicing entities only and should not be used in production by non-regulated entities.**

Rafiki is made up of several components, including an Interledger connector, a high-throughput accounting database called [TigerBeetle](https://rafiki.dev/overview/concepts/accounting#tigerbeetle), and several APIs:

- the [Admin APIs](https://rafiki.dev/apis/graphql/admin-api-overview) to create [peering relationships](https://rafiki.dev/overview/concepts/interledger#peers),
  add supported [assets](https://rafiki.dev/overview/concepts/accounting#assets), and issue [wallet addresses](https://rafiki.dev/resources/glossary#wallet-address)
- the [Open Payments](https://rafiki.dev/overview/concepts/open-payments) API to allow third parties (with the account holder's consent) to initiate payments and to view the transaction history
- the [SPSP](https://rafiki.dev/resources/glossary#simple-payment-setup-protocol-spsp) API for simple Interledger Payments

Additionally, this package also includes a reference implementation of a [GNAP](https://rafiki.dev/resources/glossary#grant-negotiation-and-authorization-protocol-gnap) authorization server, which handles the access control for the Open Payment API. For more information on the architecture, check out the [Architecture documentation](https://rafiki.dev/resources/architecture).

## Local Development Environment

### Prerequisites

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) for version control
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) to run containerized services
- [Node Version Manager (NVM)](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage Node.js versions

### Environment Setup

After you have Git, Docker, and NVM installed, run the following commands to continue setting up your local development environment.

Clone the Rafiki repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/interledger/rafiki.git
cd rafiki
```

Install Node.js

```sh
nvm install
nvm use
```

Install [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) -- a quick and efficient Node.js package manager

```sh
corepack enable
```

If you were previously using Yarn as a package manager, run this:

```sh
pnpm clean
```

Install dependencies

```sh
pnpm i
```

### Local Development

The Rafiki local environment is the best way to explore Rafiki locally. The [localenv](localenv) directory contains instructions for setting up a local playground. Please refer to the README for each individual package for more details.
