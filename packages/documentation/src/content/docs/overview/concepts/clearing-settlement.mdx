title: Clearing and settlement

## Clearing

When a payment is made over traditional banking rails, the money doesn’t move instantly. First, there are checks to confirm that the money exists and can be transferred. Clearing networks are responsible for exchanging messages between ASEs to facilitate these checks. This process is called clearing. When a payment successfully clears, it means the payer’s ASE has an obligation to the payee’s ASE.

The [Interledger Protocol (ILP)](/overview/concepts/interledger) is not a clearing network. It’s a messaging protocol that shares some similarities with traditional clearing networks.

- ASEs must peer with one another before they can send and receive ILP packets. This is comparable to traditional banking, where ASEs must use the same clearing network to transact with one another.
- ILP packets are akin to the messages exchanged during the clearing process.
- The exchange of ILP Prepare and Fulfill packets creates obligations between peers. A fulfilled ILP packet is basically a promise to pay.

Conceptually, Rafiki sits at the clearing level, but isn't a clearing network. Rafiki uses ILP to [track liquidity](/overview/concepts/accounting) between assets, payments, and peers. An ASE must still connect Rafiki to their existing backend system and internal ledger for authentication, fetching exchange rates, and managing liquidity itself. For example, if an incoming payment completes in Rafiki, the ASE’s backend must credit the recipient’s account on their own system, however that might look.

In any case, no movement of actual money has occurred yet.

## Settlement

In traditional banking, settlement is the fulfillment of an obligation between ASEs. It turns the promise of payment into a real payment by moving actual money. This occurs over a shared settlement network, such as Fedwire in the United States.

When a payer’s ASE settles with the payee’s ASE, there’s a high chance that the ASE isn’t physically handing over cash. There’s more likely to be an intermediary, like a reserve bank or central bank, that maintains accounts for both ASEs. The intermediary moves funds from one account to another, crediting and debiting the accounts as necessary.

The concept of settlement&mdash;finalizing a transaction by exchanging actual funds&mdash;is no different in ILP. However, ILP itself is not a settlement network and cannot exchange funds. A shared settlement network between ASEs, such as Fedwire, is still required. When ASEs agree to [peer with one another](/integration/requirements/peers), one piece they must agree on is which settlement network to use.

Like ILP, Rafiki also doesn't facilitate settlement. It does, however, [keep track of liquidity](/overview/concepts/accounting) through the use of liquidity and settlement accounts. Liquidity accounts track deposit, withdrawal, and transfer amounts. Settlement accounts track the availability of funds, denominated in a single asset. A negative balance means funds are available. The closer a settlement account’s balance is to zero, the more likely it is that one peer needs to settle with the other over their agreed-upon settlement network.
