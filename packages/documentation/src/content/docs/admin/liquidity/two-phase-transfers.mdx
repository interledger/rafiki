title: Two-phase transfers

import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components'

Rafiki allows for two-phase transfers, which moves funds in two stages.

1. Reserve funds (`pending`)
2. Resolve funds (`post`, `void`, or `expire`)

The following transactions support two-phase transfers:

- Asset liquidity withdrawal
- Peer liquidity withdrawal
- Incoming payment withdrawal
- Outgoing payment withdrawal
- Wallet address withdrawal

When a withdraw-liquidity transaction is requested with a timeout greater than `0`, the transaction processes as a two-phase transfer. A `0` denotes the absence of a timeout.

If the timeout interval passes before the transaction posts or is voided, the transaction expires and the full amount is returned to the original account.

## Manage two-phase transfers using the Backend Admin API

### Post and commit a successful transfer

<Tabs>

    success
    }
  }
  ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Variables">
  ```json
  {
  "input": {
    "withdrawalId": "b4f85d5c-652d-472d-873c-4ba2a5e39052",

    }
  }
  ```
  For more information about this mutation's input object, see [`PostLiquidityWithdrawalInput`](https://rafiki.dev/apis/graphql/backend/inputobjects/#postliquiditywithdrawalinput).
