The Rafiki Admin application provides tools to manage peers, assets, wallet addresses, webhooks, payments, and account settings. The purpose of this document is to help you navigate and use the Rafiki Admin application effectively.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- Familiarity with general Rafiki concepts. The [Rafiki overview](/overview/overview) is a great place to start.
- Running the Rafiki `frontend` package. See [Frontend service](/integration/services/frontend-service) for more information.
- Rafiki Admin login credentials

:::note[Login credentials]
The admin user must run a script to generate a registration link and then send that link to a user via email or Slack. Currently, the process for obtaining login credentials is not automated, nor is the method for sending a registration link.

For more information about obtaining login credentials, refer to the [Admin UI](/integration/playground/overview/#admin-ui) section of the local playground page.

## Navigation

After logging in, you’ll be greeted by the main landing page with a left-hand navigation menu. This menu provides access to all of the main functionality needed to manage your Rafiki instance.

<LargeImg
  src='/img/admin-guide/home.png'
  alt='Rafiki Admin application user interface welcome screen with navigation options like Home, Peers, Assets, Wallet Addresses, Webhooks, and more on the left sidebar.'
/>

Each of the following menu items leads to a different page of the Rafiki Admin application:

- [Peers](#peers)
- [Assets](#assets)
- [Wallet addresses](#wallet-addresses)
- [Webhooks](#webhooks)
- [Payments](#payments)
- [Account settings](#account-settings)

## Peers

The Peers page allows you to manage peering relationships in your Rafiki instance, including viewing, creating, editing, and deleting peers.

On this page, all configured peers are displayed in a table where you can view the peer name, its ILP address, asset details including the asset type and scale, and the outgoing HTTP endpoint.

<LargeImg
  src='/img/admin-guide/peers.png'
  alt='A screenshot of the Rafiki Admin application user interface displaying the "Peers" section. It shows a table containing a peer with details including ILP address, asset, and outgoing HTTP endpoint. A "Create peer" button is in the top right.'
/>

### Create peer

To create a new peer, select **Create Peer** from the main Peers page.

  alt='A screenshot of the Rafiki Admin application user interface displaying the "Create Peer" section. It shows several text fields to configure in order to create a new peer. A "Create" button is in the lower right.'
/>

Fill out the following fields to configure and create your peer:

|                     | Outgoing Auth Token  | A single token used by your Rafiki instance for all outgoing requests to authenticate itself with the peer. |
|                     | Outgoing Endpoint    | The URL of the peer’s server where your Rafiki instance sends outgoing requests.                            |

Confirm the deletion by typing "delete peer" into the text field and selecting **Delete this peer**.

## Assets

The Assets page allows you to manage assets in your Rafiki instance, including viewing, editing, and creating assets.

On this page, all configured assets are displayed in a table where you can view the asset ID, the asset code, the scale, and the withdrawal threshold.

| Sending Fee           | Fixed Fee          | Flat fee per asset, specified in the smallest unit as defined by the asset scale. In our screenshot above, a fixed fee value of 100 with a scale of 2 represents 1 USD. |

:::note[What if I need to edit or delete a wallet address?]
When managing wallet addresses in Rafiki, there are certain restrictions and limitations to be aware of:

**Editing wallet address URLs**

The URL of an existing wallet address cannot be edited. Changing the URL could disrupt the transaction history associated with that wallet address, potentially leading to inaccuracies in payment records.

**Deleting wallet addresses**

Wallet addresses cannot be deleted from the system. This restriction exists to ensure that any payments tied to a wallet address remain intact and accessible for reporting purposes.

**Solution**

In both cases, the recommended approach is to create a new wallet address and deactivate the old one. To deactivate a wallet address, change the wallet status to Inactive.
:::

## Webhooks

The Webhook Events page allows you to monitor and manage webhook events within your Rafiki instance. Webhook events in Rafiki are the main communication channel between you and your Rafiki instance. See Webhook events for more information about webhook events.

All webhook events that have been triggered are displayed in the table. For each webhook event, you can see the webhook ID, the event type, and the date and time of the event. There is also a field at the top of the page allowing you to filter the table by event type, making it easier to drill down into specific events.

<LargeImg
  src='/img/admin-guide/webhooks.png'
  alt='A screenshot of the Rafiki Admin application user interface displaying the "Webhook Events" section. It shows a table containing one webhook event with details including ID, type of webhook, and the date of the event. A "View data" button is also present in the table row for a detailed JSON view of the event data.'
/>

To view the webhook event as a JSON representation, select **View data**.

## Payments

The Payments page allows you to view all incoming and outgoing payments in your Rafiki instance. This allows you to monitor payment activity as well as track the status of payments.

All payments are displayed in the table. For each payment, you can view the unique payment ID, type of payment, state of the payment, and the date and time the payment was created. There is also a field at the top of the page allowing you to filter the table by payment type, making it easier to drill down into specific transactions.

<LargeImg
  src='/img/admin-guide/payments.png'
  alt='A screenshot of the Rafiki Admin application user interface displaying the "Payments" section. It shows a table where payment details would be displayed including ID, payment type, payment state, and the date of the payment.'
/>

## Account settings

The Account Settings page allows you to manage your personal account information, including updating your email address and password.

<LargeImg
  src='/img/admin-guide/payments.png'
  alt='A screenshot of the Rafiki Admin application user interface displaying the "Account Settings" section. It shows two text fields: one to change an email address and one to change a password.'
/>

To change your email address, enter the new email address and select **Save**.

To change your password, enter your new password and select **Save**.
