The Rafiki Admin application provides tools to manage peers, assets, wallet addresses, webhooks, payments, and account settings. It functions as an interface to the Rafiki [backend service](/integration/deployment/services/backend-service/) and all actions performed, such as fetching data or executing commands, are passed to the Rafiki `backend` service. The purpose of this document is to help you navigate and use the Rafiki Admin application effectively.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- Familiarity with general Rafiki concepts. The [Rafiki overview](/overview/overview) is a great place to start.
- Running the Rafiki `frontend` package. See [Frontend service](/integration/deployment/services/frontend-service) for more information.

## Identity and user management

Rafiki Admin relies on the <LinkOut href="https://www.ory.sh/docs/kratos/ory-kratos-intro">Ory Kratos</LinkOut> identity and user management solution to handle authentication (login) and user management (account creation and password recovery).

:::note
Ory Kratos and Rafiki Admin should be hosted on the same top-level domain. Hosting Kratos on a subdomain is generally not recommended by Ory, but if you choose this approach, ensure you follow the guidelines provided in the <LinkOut href="https://www.ory.sh/docs/kratos/debug/csrf#running-on-separate-subdomains">Kratos documentation</LinkOut>.
:::

### Login and account management

Access to Rafiki Admin uses an invitation-only system to ensure that only authorized users can register for an account. New users must be invited by an administrator. The registration flow is not public, so users cannot sign up on their own. Instead, administrators create accounts using the `invite-user` script.

#### Invite a user

An administrator (someone with backend interface system access) can run the `invite-user` script in one of two ways: from outside the container on the host machine where Docker is running or directly inside the Rafiki Admin Docker container.

```nginx title="Outside container on host machine"
docker exec -it <admin-container-name> npm run invite-user -- example@mail.com
```

```nginx title="Inside Rafiki Admin Docker container"
npm run invite-user -- example@mail.com
```

After running the `invite-user` script, the script generates a recovery link that also serves as an invitation link. This link is output to the terminal, and the administrator can send it to the user. When the user opens the link in their browser, they are automatically logged in and taken to the account settings page where they can set a new password. Afterward, they can log in normally via the Rafiki Admin URL.

<LargeImg
  src='/img/admin-guide/account-settings.png'
  alt='A screenshot of the Rafiki Admin application user interface displaying the "Account Settings" section. It shows two text fields: one to change an email address and one to change a password.'
/>

:::note
The invitation link is single-use for security purposes. Once accessed, it becomes invalid.

If sending the link through Slack, ensure you format it as code by placing it inside backticks (\`) to prevent Slack from automatically previewing the link, which would invalidate it. For example:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```js wrap
`http://localhost:4433/self-service/recovery?flow=116250ee-07bd-4b5c-a98e-87406192bb4b&token=miv0yZ7DFKKw8RyBBQvWoOsTRa2TVuZm`
```

:::

#### Generate a recovery link

Rafiki Admin provides an automated account recovery flow which requires an SMTP mail server for sending recovery links to users. Alternatively, an administrator can generate a recovery link using the same `invite-user` script.

#### Remove a user

To remove a user, administrators can run the following script in a terminal window:

```nginx
docker exec -it <admin-container-name> npm run delete-user -- example@mail.com.
```

### Why Ory Kratos?

We chose Kratos for its open-source nature, lightweight design, and robust security features. It eliminates the need to manage password hashing, storage, or account recovery flows ourselves, allowing us to focus on what we do best.

Kratos also enhances security with features like built-in breach detection, secure session management, and regular security updates.

Ory Kratos provides frontend components (such as forms and buttons) for identity management flows like login, and account settings. These components are not fixed in design; they are fetched via API calls which allows us to match the identity management components with Rafiki Admin's overall look and feel.

## Navigation

After logging in, you’ll be greeted by the main landing page with a left-hand navigation menu. This menu provides access to the main functionality needed to manage your Rafiki instance.

<LargeImg
  src='/img/admin-guide/home.png'
  alt='Rafiki Admin application user interface welcome screen with navigation options like Home, Peers, Assets, Wallet Addresses, Webhooks, and more on the left sidebar.'
/>

Each of the following menu items leads to a different page of the Rafiki Admin application:

- [Peers](#peers)
- [Assets](#assets)
- [Wallet addresses](#wallet-addresses)
- [Webhooks](#webhooks)
- [Payments](#payments)
- [Account settings](#account-settings)

## Peers

The Peers page allows you to manage peering relationships in your Rafiki instance, including viewing, creating, editing, and deleting peers.

On this page, all configured peers appear in a table where you can view the peer name, its ILP address, asset details including the asset type and scale, and the outgoing HTTP endpoint.

<LargeImg
  src='/img/admin-guide/peers.png'

:::note[Wallet address requirements]

- At least one asset must be created before creating a new wallet address. Refer to [Create asset](#create-asset) for more information.
- Wallet address URLs are treated as case-insensitive, meaning that both lowercase and uppercase variations of the same address will be recognized as identical.
  :::

After completing this section, select **Create** to add the new wallet address.

### Edit wallet address

:::note[What if I need to edit or delete a wallet address?]
When managing wallet addresses in Rafiki, there are certain restrictions and limitations to be aware of:

**Editing wallet address URLs**

The URL of an existing wallet address cannot be edited. Changing the URL could disrupt the transaction history associated with that wallet address, potentially leading to inaccuracies in payment records.

**Deleting wallet addresses**

Wallet addresses cannot be deleted from the system. This restriction exists to ensure that any payments tied to a wallet address remain intact and accessible for reporting purposes.

**Solution**

In both cases, the recommended approach is to create a new wallet address and deactivate the old one. To deactivate a wallet address, change the wallet status to Inactive.
:::

## Webhooks

The Webhook Events page allows you to monitor and manage webhook events within your Rafiki instance. Webhook events in Rafiki are the main communication channel between you and your Rafiki instance. See Webhook events for more information about webhook events.

All triggered webhook events appear in the table. For each webhook event, you can see the webhook ID, the event type, and the date and time of the event. A field at the top of the page allows you to filter the table by event type, making it easier to drill down into specific events.

<LargeImg
  src='/img/admin-guide/webhooks.png'
  alt='A screenshot of the Rafiki Admin application user interface displaying the "Webhook Events" section. It shows a table containing one webhook event with details including ID, type of webhook, and the date of the event. A "View data" button is also present in the table row for a detailed JSON view of the event data.'
/>

To view the webhook event as a JSON representation, select **View data**.

## Payments

The Payments page allows you to view all incoming and outgoing payments in your Rafiki instance. This allows you to monitor payment activity as well as track the status of payments.

All payments appear in the table. For each payment, you can view the unique payment ID, type of payment, state of the payment, and the date and time the payment was created. A field at the top of the page allows you to filter the table by payment type, making it easier to drill down into specific transactions.

<LargeImg
  src='/img/admin-guide/payments.png'
  alt='A screenshot of the Rafiki Admin application user interface displaying the "Payments" section. It shows a table where payment details would be displayed including ID, payment type, payment state, and the date of the payment.'
