title: Webhook event types
---

Webhooks notify you of specific events that occur within your Rafiki instance, allowing you to integrate Interledger payments with your system and business processes. For example, Rafiki can notify you when one of your account holders has received an Interledger payment, at which point you would credit their account on your ledger.

The following is an enumeration of all of Rafiki's [webhook event](/integration/requirements/webhook-events) types along with their descriptions, which you must listen to and handle.
