Environment variables are key value pairs used to configure how your Rafiki instance will run within your infrastructure and integrate with your systems.

Each environment variable name is uppercase, followed by an equal sign and the value of the variable.

```bash title='Environment variable example'
WEBHOOKS_URL=http://my-business/webhooks
```

The environment variable in the preceding example specifies the HTTP endpoint at which you want your Rafiki instance to send you notifications of webhook events.

To run Rafiki you must set the environment variables for the `backend`, `auth` and `frontend` services where listed as required below.

<VarWarn />

## Backend

<BackEnv />

## Auth

## Frontend

<FrontEnv />
