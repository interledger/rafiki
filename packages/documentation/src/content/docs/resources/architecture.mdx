Rafiki is a collection of three services that run together. Each one can scale horizontally.

- [Backend](/integration/deployment/services/backend-service) - The main service, responsible for handling business logic and external communication
- [Auth](/integration/deployment/services/auth-service) - A reference implementation of an Open Payments authorization server, used for grant authorization and authentication
- [Frontend](/integration/deployment/services/frontend-service) - An optional internal user interface, called the [Rafiki Admin](/admin/admin-user-guide), for you to manage your Rafiki instance

These services rely on a number of databases.

- A Postgres database used by the `auth` service for storing auth-related resources (grants, access tokens, and interactions)
- A Redis database used by the `auth` service to store session data
- A Postgres database used by the `backend` service for Open Payments resources and application data
- <LinkOut href='https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle'>

  , used by the `backend` service for accounting balances
- A Redis database used by the `backend` service as a cache to share STREAM connection details across processes

An additional package for [token introspection](/integration/deployment/services/auth-service#token-introspection) is also included with Rafiki. This is an internal package that requires no action on your part if you’re using Rafiki’s `auth` service.
