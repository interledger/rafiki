Each payment account belonging to your users (for example, your customers) must have at least one associated wallet address for the account to be able to send and receive payments over Interledger and Open Payments. A wallet address serves as a publicly shareable standardized ID for a payment account.

:::note[Wallet address requirements]

- Your Rafiki instance must be set up with at least one asset before wallet addresses can be created as each wallet address must have an asset assigned to it.
- Wallet address URLs are treated as case-insensitive, meaning that both lowercase and uppercase variations of the same address will be recognized as identical.

## Create wallet addresses

There are a few ways in which you can create wallet addresses.

- [Through a script](#create-wallet-addresses-through-a-script)
- [In response to the `wallet_address.not_found` webhook event](#create-wallet-addresses-in-response-to-a-webhook-event)
- [In the Rafiki Admin app](/admin/admin-user-guide#create-wallet-address)

### Create wallet addresses through a script

Writing your own script that loops through your list of account is one way to batch create wallet addresses for your existing account holders.

Ensure your script calls the `createWalletAddress` GraphQL mutation.

  <TabItem label="Operation">
    ```graphql
    mutation CreateWalletAddress($input: CreateWalletAddressInput!) {
      createWalletAddress(input: $input) {
        code
        success
        message
        walletAddress {
          id
          createdAt
          publicName
          url
          asset {
            code
            id
            scale
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```
    We strongly recommend you store at least the `walletAddress.id` in your internal database to be able to reference the account and wallet address later.

          }

    }

</Tabs>

### Create wallet addresses in response to a webhook event

The [`wallet_address.not_found`](/integration/requirements/webhook-events#wallet-address-not-found) event fires when a wallet address is requested through the Open Payments Get Wallet Address API, but Rafiki can't find the address.

When you receive the event, look up the associated account in your system, then call the `createWalletAddress` mutation to create a wallet address for the account.

The mutation and example JSON request/response is the same as what's given [above](#create-wallet-addresses-through-a-script).
