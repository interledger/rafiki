The main communication channel between you and your Rafiki instance is composed of the Backend Admin API and a set of webhook events.

Most events require you to interact with Rafiki to provide wallet address information or manage (deposit or withdraw) liquidity. This page describes how you should handle each webhook event.

:::note
Rafiki doesn't hold _user_ account balances. Instead, Rafiki keeps track of the liquidity within your instance's asset, peer, and payment accounts within its own database.
:::

## Specify your webhook endpoint

For Rafiki to notify you about webhook events, you must expose a webhook endpoint that listens for the events dispatched by Rafiki. These events notify your system of time-sensitive status updates, warnings, and errors so that you can react accordingly.

When an event occurs, the [`backend`](/integration/deployment/services/backend-service) service makes a <Badge text="POST" variant="success" size="medium"/> request to your configured webhook endpoint. The `backend` service expects a `200` status in return.

<div class="overflow-table">

| Variable      | Type      | Description                                                         |
| ------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `WEBHOOK_URL` | `backend` | The endpoint to where requests are made when a webhook event occurs |

</div>

## Webhook event request body

Each webhook event is sent as a JSON payload with the following structure in the request body. The parameters within the `data` object will vary depending on the event.

<div class="overflow-table">

| Attribute | Type   | Description                                         | Required |
| --------- | ------ | --------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| `id`      | String | UUID for the event                                  | Y        |
| `type`    | Enum   | The `EventType`                                     | Y        |
| `data`    | Object | Additional data that coincides with the `EventType` | Y        |

</div>

:::tip[Duplicate events]
The `id` in the webhook event payload is unique. Your system can use the ID to determine whether the event has been received previously, preventing duplicate event processing.

We provide an <LinkOut href="https://github.com/interledger/rafiki/blob/main/packages/backend/src/openapi/specs/webhooks.yaml">OpenAPI specification</LinkOut> for the webhook events fired by Rafiki.

Additionally, the [local playground](/integration/playground/overview) contains example payloads in the <LinkOut href="https://github.com/interledger/rafiki/tree/main/bruno/collections/Rafiki/Sample%20Webhook%20Events">Bruno collection</LinkOut> that can be used to test your webhook service integration.

## Verify webhook signatures

To protect your endpoint from unauthorized or spoofed requests, Rafiki supports an optional, but highly recommended, webhook signature verification process. By enabling signature verification, you can ensure that webhook requests are genuinely from Rafiki, and have not been tampered with.

Each webhook request includes a `Rafiki-Signature` header with a timestamp, version, and signature digest. If your instance is configured with both the `SIGNATURE_SECRET` (to generate the signature) and the `SIGNATURE_VERSION` (to set the version, defaults to v1) environment variables, you can verify the authenticity of each webhook request using the steps below.

### Extract the timestamp and signature from the header

The `Rafiki-Signature` header in each webhook request has the following format:

<CodeBlock title="Rafiki-Signature header">

```
Rafiki-Signature: t=<timestamp>, v<version>=<signature_digest>
```

</CodeBlock>

- `t=<timestamp>`: The UNIX timestamp (in seconds) when the signature was generated.
- `v<version>=<digest>`: The versioned HMAC SHA-256 signature digest. The default version is `v1`.

### Prepare the signed payload string

To recreate the signed payload string, concatenate the following.

- The timestamp extracted from the header
- A period (.) character
- The actual JSON payload from the request body, containing the `id`, `type`, and `data` attributes

This string format is essential for accurate signature validation.

### Generate the expected signature

Use HMAC SHA-256 with the `SIGNATURE_SECRET` environment variable as the key and the signed payload string as the message.

### Compare the signatures

Finally, compare the signature in the header to the expected signature you generated. For security, use a constant-time comparison function to prevent timing attacks.

### Example

Below is an example in JavaScript to verify Rafiki's webhook signature:

<CodeBlock title="Verify webhook signature example">

```js
function verifyWebhookSignature(request: Request): boolean {
  const signatureParts = request.headers['Rafiki-Signature'].split(', ')
  const timestamp = signatureParts[0].split('=')[1]
  const signatureVersionAndDigest = signatureParts[1].split('=')
  const signatureVersion = signatureVersionAndDigest[0].replace('v', '')
  const signatureDigest = signatureVersionAndDigest[1]
  if (signatureVersion !== config['SIGNATURE_VERSION']) {
    return false
  }
  const payload = `${timestamp}.${canonicalize(request.body)}`
  const hmac = createHmac('sha256', config['SIGNATURE_SECRET'])
  hmac.update(payload)
  const digest = hmac.digest('hex')
  return digest === signatureDigest
}
```

</CodeBlock>

## Event handling

### Asynchronous handling

If requests to credit/debit user accounts are lengthy processes, we recommend using a worker to process received events. The worker allows the server to process events at a rate suitable for your system and reduces the number of failed/retried events since your event listener can immediately reply with a successful `200` status.

### Error handling

If a non-200 status is returned, indicating an error, or the request times out, Rafiki will retry the webhook request at increasing intervals until a `200` status is returned. You can configure

The first retry is after 10 seconds. Additional retries occur after 20 more seconds, then after 30 more seconds, and so on.

`}
/>

</details>

The `incoming_payment.created` event indicates an incoming payment was created. At this point, the incoming payment has not received any funds.

The incoming payment will either complete or expire.

#### Incoming payment completed

<details>
<summary>Expand for event sequences</summary>

      ASE->>R: Backend Admin API call: PostLiquidityWithdrawal
      R->>R: Two-phase transfer completed

`}
/>

</details>

The `incoming_payment.completed` event indicates the payment completed either automatically or manually, and that any funds received into the incoming payment should be withdrawn and then credited to the recipient's account on your ledger.

#### Incoming payment expired

<details>
<summary>Expand for event sequence</summary>
  \$2.55 was received before the payment expired. The recipient is thus credited with \$2.55.

  <Mermaid

      ASE->>ASE: Credit recipient's account with $2.55

`}
/>

</details>

The `incoming_payment.expired` event will only fire if funds were received for the incoming payment. The event signals the end of any additional payments.

The primary use case for this event is to know when a streaming payment, such as one supported through <LinkOut href="https://webmonetization.org">Web Monetization</LinkOut>, has expired. In response to the event, any funds already received for the payment should be withdrawn and credited to the recipient's account on your ledger.

:::note
In some scenarios, a sender may not have specified an `incomingAmount` when the incoming payment was created. Receiving an `incoming_payment.expired` event indicates that no further payments are expected.

        ASE->>R: Backend Admin API call: CancelOutgoingPayment,<br/>reason: Insufficient funds
      end

`}
/>

</details>

The `outgoing_payment.created` event indicates an outgoing payment was created and is awaiting liquidity. Verify the sender's account balance and perform any other necessary verifications before funding the payment.

If the sender has insufficient funds or if the payment should otherwise not be fulfilled, cancel the outgoing payment. Otherwise, put a hold on the sender's account and deposit the funds into Rafiki.

#### Outgoing payment completed

<details>
<summary>Expand for event sequences</summary>
{' '}

<Badge text='Single-phase transfer' variant='tip' size='medium' /> An outgoing payment

      R->>R: Two-phase transfer complete

`}
/>

</details>

The `outgoing.payment_completed` event indicates that as much as possible has been sent to the recipient against their incoming payment.

If there is excess liquidity in Rafiki due to differences between the sent and received amounts, withdraw the excess from the outgoing payment. What you choose to do with the excess is a business decision. One option is to return the excess to the sender. Another option is to retain the excess as a service fee. Lastly, remove the hold on your sender's account and debit their account on your ledger.

#### Outgoing payment failed

<details>
<summary>Expand for event sequence</summary>
An outgoing payment for \$12 failed. \$8 was sent successfully.

  <Mermaid
    graph={`sequenceDiagram
      participant R as Rafiki

      ASE->>R: Backend Admin API call: CreateOutgoingPaymentWithdrawal
      ASE->>ASE: Remove hold and deduct $8 from the sender's account

`}
/>

</details>

The `outgoing_payment.failed` event indicates that an outgoing payment has either partially or completely failed and a retry was unsuccessful. Withdraw any remaining liquidity from the outgoing payment in Rafiki. If the payment failed completely (the `sentAmount` is `0`), remove the hold from your sender's account. If the payment partially failed, remove the hold from your sender's account, then debit the sender's account on your ledger with the amount that was sent successfully. Since there will be a discrepancy between the quoted amount and the actual sent amount, we suggest you refrain from taking a sending fee.

### Wallet addresses

<div class="overflow-table">

</details>

The `asset.liquidity_low` event indicates that an asset's liquidity has dropped below your predefined liquidity threshold. Check if you already have, or can acquire, additional liquidity for that specific asset. If so, deposit it in Rafiki. Cross-currency transfers will fail if you don't increase the asset's liquidity.

### Low peer liquidity

<div class="overflow-table">

</details>

The `peer.liquidity_low` event indicates that a peer's liquidity has dropped below your predefined liquidity threshold. Decide whether you want to extend the peer's credit line or if your peer must settle before you will extend a new line of credit. If you cannot or do not increase the peer liquidity in Rafiki, transfers to that peer will fail.
