If you plan to support cross-currency transactions, you must specify from where your Rafiki instance will fetch current exchange rates.

A rate probe precedes every Interledger payment. The probe provides a quote that estimates the full cost of transferring value over the network. For a rate probe involving a cross-currency transaction to be successful, Rafiki needs to know the exchange rates for each currency that makes up the transaction.

Often, it's the receiving ASE that provides the exchange rates for each ILP packet. For example, say you and your peer transact in USD. Your peer also supports MXN. If a USD payment from your side is addressed to a wallet address set up for MXN on your peer's side, then your peer would provide the USD to MXN exchange rate.

## Specify your exchange rates endpoint

Rafiki fetches exchange rates from your exchange rates endpoint. Set your endpoint via the `backend` service's `EXCHAGE_RATES_URL` variable. An <LinkOut href="https://github.com/interledger/rafiki/blob/main/packages/backend/src/openapi/specs/exchange-rates.yaml">OpenAPI specification</LinkOut> for the endpoint is available.

<CodeBlock title='Example'>

```
EXCHANGE_RATES_URL: http://cloud-nine-wallet/rates
```

</CodeBlock>

The endpoint must accept <Badge text="GET" variant="note" size="medium"/> requests and respond as follows.

<CodeBlock title='Example API request'>

```
GET https://cloud-nine-wallet/rates
```

</CodeBlock>

<CodeBlock title='Example API response'>

```
{
    "base": "USD",
    "rates": {
        "EUR": 0.813399,
    }
}
```

### Response objects

<div class="overflow-table">

| Variable             | Type   | Description                                                                                                                        | Required |
| -------------------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| `base`               | String | The asset code represented as an <LinkOut href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217">ISO 4217</LinkOut> currency code, e.g. USD | Y        |
| `rates`              | Object | Object containing `<asset_code : exchange_rate>` pairs, e.g. `{EUR: 0.8930}`                                                       | Y        |
| `rates.<asset_code>` | Number | The exchange rate given `base` and `<asset_code>`                                                                                  | Y        |

</div>

## Specify rate caching duration (optional)

Specify how long your Rafiki instance will cache exchange rates via the `backend` service's `EXCHANGE_RATES_LIFETIME` variable or use the default setting of `15_000` ms (15 seconds).

Caching improves performance as Rafiki will not need to request the rates from your endpoint for every payment.

## Specify slippage (optional)

As exchange rates and fees charged by connectors fluctuate, there will likely be a variance between the estimated amount provided in the quote and the actual amount required when the payment is initiated. This difference is called slippage.

Set your allowed slippage rate to a value between 0 and 1 via the `backend` service's `SLIPPAGE` variable or use the default setting of `0.01` (1%).

<CodeBlock title='Example'>

```
SLIPPAGE: 0.05
```

</CodeBlock>

### Example

Let's say your Rafiki instance is using the default slippage of `0.01` (1%). The rate probe that precedes a USD payment returns a quote of `$1.00`. One percent of one dollar equals one cent.

If the total of the payment, inclusive of currency exchange rates and network fees, amounts to `$1.01`, the payment will be successful. If the total is `$1.02` or more, the payment will fail.

Below is a minimalistic example of a successful (200) response.

```json
export function loader({ request }: LoaderFunctionArgs) {
  const base = new URL(request.url).searchParams.get('base') || 'USD'

  return json(
    {
      base,
      rates: config.seed.rates[base] || {}
    },
    { status: 200 }
  )
}
```
