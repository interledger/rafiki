title: Identity provider (IdP)

An identity provider (IdP) is a system or service that stores and manages user identity information, authentication, and consent. Examples of IdPs include OpenID Connect and Okta.

Open Payments requires any authorization server that issues interactive grants be integrated with an IdP. Interactive grants are used to gather consent. More information about interactive grants is available [below](#interactive-grants).

Responsibilities of your IdP include:

- Providing an interface to gather end-user consent for a particular action
- Sending the interaction choice (approve or deny) to the authorization server
- Sending a request to the authorization server to finish the interaction
- Redirecting the user after the interaction is complete

:::note
We provide Ory Kratos, a cloud-based user management system, for the identity and user management of your Rafiki Admin users. Kratos is for internal use only and **cannot** be used as your IdP for Open Payments.

## Interactive grants

In Open Payments, grants indicate a resource owner, such as an account holder, has given a piece of software, such as a mobile app, permission (consent) to act on their behalf.

Rafiki's implementation of an Open Payments authorization server requires that consent is collected via an interactive grant before an <LinkOut href="https://openpayments.dev/concepts/resources/#outgoing-payment">outgoing payment</LinkOut> request is issued. A grant is interactive when explicit interaction by a resource owner (for example, the software's end user) is required to approve or deny the grant. Tapping an _Approve_ button to authorize a payment is an example of an explicit interaction.

Interactive grants can be optional for incoming payments and quotes; however, they're enabled by default in Rafiki (the `LIST_ALL_ACCESS_INTERACTION` environment variable is `true`). When a grant request includes a `list-all` action for incoming payments and quotes, the request requires interaction. The `list-all` action is used when the client asks to list resources that it did not create.

If `LIST_ALL_ACCESS_INTERACTION` is `false`, you can still force interactive grants for quotes and/or incoming payments by setting the respective variables to `true`.

- `QUOTE_INTERACTION`
- `INCOMING_PAYMENT_INTERACTION`

See the <LinkOut href="https://openpayments.dev/identity/grants/">Open Payments documentation</LinkOut> for more information on grant negotiation and authorization.

## Authorization servers

Authorization servers grant permission to clients to access the Open Payments Resource APIs. This enables clients to create incoming payments, quotes, and outgoing payments against an account holder's account.

Rafiki's [auth service](/integration/deployment/services/auth-service) provides you with a reference implementation of an Open Payments authorization server. You can use the service as an alternative to developing your own in-house service.

Rafiki's authorization server also extends an [API](#interaction-endpoints) that provides interaction endpoints for your IdP.

### Environment variables

The following variables must be configured for the `auth` service.

## Interaction endpoints

The authorization server provided by Rafiki's `auth` service extends an API for an IdP server to use after a pending grant request is created.

Each interaction with an endpoint is identified by an `id` and a `nonce`. Both are provided as query parameters when the authorization server redirects to the IdP server.

The endpoints are tied to the auth server URL. For example, if your auth server URL is `https://auth.wallet.example.com`, then calling the `/interact/{id}/{nonce}` endpoint to start a user interaction session would look as follows:

```
https://auth.wallet.example.com/interact/{id}/{nonce}
```

### Interaction endpoints

The endpoints are called in the sequence listed below.

<div class="overflow-table">

| <Badge text="POST" variant="success" size="medium"/> | `/interact/{id}/{nonce}`        | [Continue grant](#continue-grant)                                 | Open Payments client | Yes              |

</div>

We also provide an <LinkOut href="https://github.com/interledger/rafiki/blob/main/packages/auth/src/openapi/specs/id-provider.yaml">OpenAPI specification</LinkOut> that describes the endpoints. Note that the _Continue grant_ endpoint is not included in the spec because it's part of the <LinkOut href="https://openpayments.dev/apis/auth-server/operations/post-continue/">Open Payments Auth Server API</LinkOut>.

#### Start user interaction session

Called by the client to establish an interactive session with the authorization server. The authorization server automatically redirects the request, via the URL defined in the `IDENTITY_SERVER_URL` variable, to your IdP consent screen.

#### Look up grant information

Called by the IdP server to retrieve a list of access rights, requested by the client, from the authorization server. The request is secured with an [`x-idp-secret`](#x-idp-secret-header) header. The access rights are presented to the client's end-user on the consent screen. The authorization server's response is served on your configured `INTERACTION_PORT`.

#### Accept or reject grant

The IdP server communicates the choice made by the end-user on the consent screen (accept/reject) to the authorization server. The request is secured with an [`x-idp-secret`](#x-idp-secret-header) header. The authorization server responds to the IdP server, acknowledging that it received the request.

#### Finish interaction

Called by the IdP server to end the interaction. If a `finish` URI was provided in the original grant initialization request, the authorization server redirects the user to that URI.

The `result` query parameter in the response indicates the success or failure of the grant authorization. The following are examples of the possible response types.

| Success  | The grant was successful with the following returned in the response:<br /><ul><li>A hash representing the SHA-256 hash of values provided by the client in the <LinkOut href="https://openpayments.dev/apis/auth-server/operations/post-request/">grant initialization request</LinkOut> (`interact.finish.nonce`), and the values in the response returned from the authorization server (`interact.finish`).</li><li>The `interact_ref` that identifies the interaction on the authorization server alongside the hash</li><li>The URI of the grant initialization request (for example, `https://www.auth-server.com`)</li></ul> | `hash=p28jsq0Y2KK3WS__a42tavNC64ldGTBroywsWxT4md_jZQ1R\HZT8BOWYHcLmObM7XHPAdJzTZMtKBsaraJ64A &interact_ref=4IFWWIKYBC2PQ6U56NL1` |

</div>

When successful, the SHA-256 hash of the interaction is sent in the response to the client, along with an `interact_ref` that identifies the interaction on the authorization server and the URI of the grant initialization request. The client must verify the hash before the client requests the grant to continue.

#### Continue grant

The client requests a grant from the authorization server for an accepted interaction. The authorization server responds with an <LinkOut href="https://openpayments.dev/apis/auth-server/operations/post-continue/">access token</LinkOut>.

## X-idp-secret header

The `x-idp-secret` header is specific to Rafiki's authorization server and is used for requests to the following endpoints:

- `GET /grant/:id/:nonce`
- `POST /grant/:id/:nonce/accept`
- `POST /grant/:id/:nonce/reject`

The header's purpose is to secure communications between the IdP and the authorization server. Its value should be a shared secret known to both entities. When the IdP server sends requests to the authorization server, the IdP must provide the secret via this header.

:::note
If you're running your own authorization server rather than using the server provided by Rafiki, you can add security in any way you see fit. You aren't required to use the `x-idp-secret` header.
:::

To set up the header, set the `IDENTITY_SERVER_SECRET` variable to a value that is also used to configure your IdP server's requests to the authorization server.
