Rafiki’s <LinkOut href="https://github.com/interledger/rafiki/tree/main/packages/backend">`backend`</LinkOut> service is the software’s main service for handling business logic and external communication. The service is responsible for:

- Exposing the endpoints of the [Open Payments APIs](#open-payments) for public clients to initiate payments and look up information. This is the external communication piece.
- Exposing an [Interledger connector](#interledger-connector) to send and receive STREAM packets with peers.
- Enabling you to manage accounts and track liquidity.
- Exposing an internal [GraphQL Backend Admin API](#graphql-backend-admin-api) for service operators to manage accounts, liquidity, and application settings, like peering relationships.

## Requirements

The following are required when using the `backend` service.

- A Redis database as a cache to share STREAM connection details and total amounts received across processes
- A Postgres database, separate from the `auth` service’s database, for Open Payments resources
- TigerBeetle or a separate Postgres database for accounting liquidity
  :::note
  You can use the same database instance of Postgres for the `backend` service, `auth` service, and accounting liquidity (if not using TigerBeetle). However, separate database schemas are required within the Rafiki instance to maintain boundaries between the managed objects.
  :::

You must also set the environment variables for the `backend` service.

## Open Payments

The `backend` service exposes the Open Payments APIs, which are auth-protected using an opinionated version of the Grant Negotiation and Authorization Protocol (GNAP). Review the [`auth`](/integration/deployment/services/auth-service) service page for more details about grant authorization and authentication.

The `backend` service allows you to manage Open Payments <LinkOut href="https://openpayments.dev/concepts/resources/#incoming-payment">incoming payments</LinkOut>, <LinkOut href="https://openpayments.dev/concepts/resources/#quote">quotes</LinkOut>, and <LinkOut href='https://openpayments.dev/concepts/resources/#outgoing-payment'>outgoing payments</LinkOut>. Quotes and outgoing payments call the ILP connector, described in the next section, to send ILP packets. Quoting sends unfulfillable probe packets, for example to determine a transaction’s cost before executing the payment. Outgoing payments send packets as part of executing the payment.

## Interledger connector

The `backend` service exposes an ILP connector to send and receive ILP packets between peers.

Some of the responsibilities of a connector include:

- Authenticating packets against ILP account credentials.
- Forwarding packets to a sender or receiver.
- Rejecting a packet for any number of reasons, including expiration, insufficient liquidity, rate limit exceeded, or if the amount exceeds the `maxPacketAmount` [agreed to](/integration/requirements/peers#perform-prerequisites) by the connector and its peer.
- Converting currencies.
- Fulfilling packets with an internal STREAM server.

The `backend` service includes an HTTP server listening on the configured `CONNECTOR_PORT`. Your connector can receive incoming packets via HTTP and/or direct calls from within the `backend` service. An incoming packet is only accepted if it's from a configured peer and accompanied by your peer’s incoming HTTP `authToken`.

Similarly, if a packet's destination address corresponds to a peer, your connector forwards the packet to your peer over HTTP, along with your peer's outgoing HTTP `authToken`.

:::note[Auth tokens]
You and your peer should have exchanged incoming and outgoing auth tokens as part of establishing your [peering relationship](/integration/requirements/peers#perform-prerequisites).
:::

A packet can either continue on to your peer via HTTP or end at your Rafiki instance's STREAM server. If the packet terminates at your STREAM server, your connector attempts to extract and decode the payment tag from the packet's destination address. When your connector successfully matches the tag with a locally managed wallet address or incoming payment, the connector does not forward the packet. Instead, it credits the corresponding balance and track the total amount received in Redis to support STREAM receipts. Packets addressed to a wallet address happen via SPSP.

## GraphQL Backend Admin API

The `backend` service exposes a GraphQL [Backend Admin API](/apis/graphql/admin-api-overview#backend-admin-api) to manage assets, peers, wallet addresses, Open Payments resources, and several types of liquidity.
