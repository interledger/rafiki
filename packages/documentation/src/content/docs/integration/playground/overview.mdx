The Local Playground provides a suite of packages that, together, mock an account servicing entity that has deployed Rafiki. It exposes an <LinkOut href='https://interledger.org/developers/rfcs/simple-payment-setup-protocol/'>SPSP</LinkOut> endpoint, the [Open Payments APIs](/overview/concepts/open-payments) with its required <LinkOut href='https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-gnap-core-protocol/'>GNAP</LinkOut> auth endpoints to request grants, a STREAM endpoint for receiving Interledger packets, and the Rafiki Admin app to view and manage each Rafiki instance.

This suite of packages includes:

| [`frontend`](/integration/deployment/services/frontend-service) | Remix app to expose a UI for Rafiki admin management via interaction with the Backend Admin APIs     |

</div>

These packages depend on the following databases:

<img
  src='/img/localenv-databases.png'
  alt='Databases required to run Rafiki'
  style='max-width:300px'
/>

The Local Playground comes with containerized versions of the Rafiki packages and two pre-configured docker-compose files (<LinkOut href="https://github.com/interledger/rafiki/blob/main/localenv/cloud-nine-wallet/docker-compose.yml">Cloud Nine Wallet</LinkOut> and <LinkOut href='https://github.com/interledger/rafiki/blob/main/localenv/happy-life-bank/docker-compose.yml'>Happy Life Bank</LinkOut>) to start two mock account servicing entities with their respective Rafiki `backend` and `auth` servers. They automatically peer, and two to three user accounts are created on both of them.

This environment will set up a playground where you can use the GraphQL Admin APIs and the Open Payments APIs.

:::note

The Mock ASE provided in this repository is intended solely for internal use and demonstration purposes. It is not designed to serve as a reference architecture. If you are looking for a reference implementation of an ASE, please refer to the <LinkOut href='https://wallet.interledger-test.dev/'>Test Wallet</LinkOut>.
:::

## Running the local environment

To spin up the Local Playground install the following software on your machine:

- A <LinkOut href='https://github.com/interledger/rafiki/blob/main/README.md#environment-setup'>Rafiki local environment setup</LinkOut>
- The <LinkOut href='https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/'>Docker</LinkOut> platform.
- An open-source API client <LinkOut href='https://www.usebruno.com/downloads'>Bruno</LinkOut>

### Setup

The local environment can be set up using either TigerBeetle or Postgres as the accounting database.

#### Using TigerBeetle

This option enables the primary instance (Cloud Nine Wallet) to utilize TigerBeetle for its accounting database. The secondary instance (Happy Life Bank) will always run Postgres as its accounting database.

To run the local environment with TigerBeetle, execute the following command from the root of the project:

```bash title="Using TigerBeetle"
pnpm localenv:compose up
```

#### Using Postgres

If you want the primary instance (Cloud Nine Wallet) to use Postgres as the accounting database instead of TigerBeetle, you must use the `psql` variant of the `localenv:compose` command as follows:

```bash title="Using Postgres"
pnpm localenv:compose:psql up
```

The local environment consists of a primary and secondary Rafiki instance, each with its docker-compose file (<LinkOut href='https://github.com/interledger/rafiki/blob/main/localenv/cloud-nine-wallet/docker-compose.yml'>Cloud Nine Wallet</LinkOut>, <LinkOut href='https://github.com/interledger/rafiki/blob/main/localenv/cloud-nine-wallet/docker-compose.yml'>Happy Life Bank</LinkOut>). The primary Cloud Nine Wallet docker-compose file (`./cloud-nine-wallet/docker-compose.yml`) includes the primary Rafiki `backend` and `auth` services, as well as the required data stores, which include TigerBeetle (if enabled), Redis, and Postgres. The primary instance contains all of the necessary components so that it can run independently.

The secondary Happy Life Bank docker-compose file (`./happy-life-bank/docker-compose.yml`) includes only the Rafiki services, not the data stores. It uses the data stores created by the primary Rafiki instance, so it can’t be run independently. The `pnpm localenv:compose up` command starts both the primary and secondary instances.

### Environment components

The following components are made available via the Local Playground:

### Rafiki Admin

Manage and view information about the Rafiki instance(s) through the [Rafiki Admin](/admin/admin-user-guide/) application. Rafiki Admin is a Remix app for querying info and executing mutations against the Rafiki [Backend Admin API](https://rafiki.dev/integration/playground/overview#admin-apis).

- Cloud Nine Wallet - `http://localhost:3010`
- Happy Life Bank - `http://localhost:4010`

We have secured access to Rafiki Admin using <LinkOut href='https://www.ory.sh/docs/kratos/ory-kratos-intro'>Ory Kratos</LinkOut>; however, in our local playground setup we've chosen to disable user authentication for easier development and testing interactions.

:::note[Enabling Rafiki Admin authentication locally]
If you'd like to enable authentication locally you can run `pnpm localenv:compose:adminauth up`

Separate registrations/users are required for each mock ASE's Admin app as the ASEs are designed to run as separate mock entities. Visit the Rafiki Admin user guide to learn how to [invite](/admin/admin-user-guide#invite-a-user) and [remove](/admin/admin-user-guide#remove-a-user) users via provided scripts.

After you've registered, you can come back to your Rafiki Admin account by navigating to `localhost:3010` (Cloud Nine Wallet) or `localhost:4010` (Happy Life Bank) and logging in.

Follow these steps to reset a user's Rafiki Admin password.

1. Select the forgot password link and enter an email for a registered user.
2. Open [Mail Slurper](http://localhost:4436/) to access the recovery link for the account.
   :::

### Exploring Accounts on Cloud Nine Wallet

Navigate to `localhost:3030` to view the accounts on Cloud Nine Wallet.

:::note

The accounts for Happy Life Bank can be found on `localhost:3031`.

:::

Select an account name to view a list of transactions.

### Debugging

Debuggers for the services are exposed on the following ports:

| Services                | IP and Port    |
| ----------------------- | -------------- |
| Cloud Nine Backend      | 127.0.0.1:9229 |
| Cloud Nine Auth         | 127.0.0.1.9230 |
| Happy Life Bank Backend | 127.0.0.1:9231 |
| Happy Life Bank Auth    | 127.0.0.1:9232 |

#### Debugging with a Chromium browser:

1. Go to chrome://inspect
2. Select **Configure** and add the IP addresses and ports detailed above
3. Start the docker containers
4. Select **Inspect** on the service you want to debug to open the Chromium debugger.

You can either trigger the debugger by adding `debugger` statements in the code and restarting the Docker containers or by adding breakpoints directly to the Chromium debugger after starting the Docker containers.

#### Debugging with VS Code:

To debug with VS Code, add this configuration to your `.vscode/launch.json`:

```json
{
    "name": "Attach to docker (cloud-nine-backend)",
    "type": "node",
    "request": "attach",
    "port": 9229,
    "address": "localhost",
    "localRoot": "${workspaceFolder}",
    "remoteRoot": "/home/rafiki/",
    "restart": true
},
```

The `localRoot` variable will depend on the location of the `launch.json` file relative to Rafiki’s root directory.

For more ways to connect debuggers, refer to the <LinkOut href='https://nodejs.org/en/learn/getting-started/debugging'>Node JS docs</LinkOut> for debugging.

### Shutting down

To shut down your local instance, run the following commands:

```sh
# tear down
pnpm localenv:compose down

# tear down and delete database volumes
pnpm localenv:compose down --volumes

# tear down, delete database volumes and remove images
pnpm localenv:compose down --volumes --rmi all
```

### Commands

The following are the most commonly used commands:

| Description                                                       | Command                                          |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Show all merged config (with TigerBeetle)                         | `pnpm localenv:compose config`                   |
| Start (with TigerBeetle)                                          | `pnpm localenv:compose up`                       |
| Start (with TigerBeetle) detached                                 | `pnpm localenv:compose up -d`                    |
| Down (with TigerBeetle)                                           | `pnpm localenv:compose down`                     |
| Down and remove volumes (with TigerBeetle)                        | `pnpm localenv:compose down --volumes`           |
| Down and remove volumes (with TigerBeetle) and images             | `pnpm localenv:compose down --volumes --rmi all` |
| Show all merged config (with Postgres)                            | `pnpm localenv:compose:psql config`              |
| Build all the containers (with TigerBeetle)                       | `pnpm localenv:compose build`                    |
| Start (with Postgres)                                             | `pnpm localenv:compose:psql up`                  |

| Down (with Postgres) and remove volumes                           | `pnpm localenv:compose:psql down --volumes`      |
| Build all the containers (with Postgres)                          | `pnpm localenv:compose:psql build`               |
| Start with local admin auth enabled (this is disabled by default) | `pnpm localenv:compose:adminauth up `            |

:::note[Enabling TigerBeetle]

When enabled, TigerBeetle is only used by the primary instance (Cloud Nine Wallet). The secondary instance (Happy Life Bank) will always run Postgres as its accounting database.

### Interacting with the Local Playground

#### Bruno & Open Payments APIs

The Open Payments APIs can be interacted with using the [Bruno collection](https://github.com/interledger/rafiki/tree/main/bruno/collections/Rafiki) ([resource server endpoints](https://github.com/interledger/rafiki/tree/main/bruno/collections/Rafiki/Open%20Payments%20APIs) and [auth server endpoints](https://github.com/interledger/rafiki/tree/main/bruno/collections/Rafiki/Open%20Payments%20Auth%20APIs)).
To interact with the Open Payments APIs using Bruno, you must:

1. Load the collection into Bruno by selecting **Open Collection**.
2. Navigate to `/rafiki/bruno/collections/Rafiki` on your machine and select **Open**.
3. Furthermore, you need to either load the [Local Environment](https://github.com/interledger/rafiki/tree/main/bruno/collections/Rafiki/environments/Local%20Playground.bru) or the [Remote Test Network Environment](https://github.com/interledger/rafiki/tree/main/bruno/collections/Rafiki/environments/Remote.bru).

:::tip[Troubleshooting Bruno errors]

If you receive the error below while running the Bruno collection, try switching from <LinkOut href='https://docs.usebruno.com/get-started/javascript-sandbox'>Safe Mode to Developer Mode</LinkOut>

``Error invoking remote method `send-http-request`: Error : Error: Cannot find module crypto``

:::

The Examples folder in the Bruno collection includes an [Open Payments](https://github.com/interledger/rafiki/tree/main/bruno/collections/Rafiki/Examples/Open%20Payments) example that can be executed in the following sequence:

<MermaidWrapper client:load>

<Mermaid
  graph={`sequenceDiagram
    participant B as Bruno client
    participant SW as Sender's wallet
    participant RW as Recipient's wallet
    participant AS as Authorization server
    participant IdP as Identity provider

    B->>SW: 1. GET wallet address
    SW-->>B: 200 OK (authServer URL)

    B->>RW: 2. GET wallet address
    RW-->>B: 200 OK (authServer URL)

    Note over B,AS: Non-interactive grant for incoming payment resource
    B->>AS: 3. POST grant request (incoming-payment)
    AS-->>B: 200 OK (accessToken)

    B->>RW: 4. POST /incoming-payments

    Note over B,AS: Interactive grant required for outgoing payment resource
    B->>AS: 7. POST grant request (outgoing-payment)
    AS-->>B: 200 OK (redirect_uri)

    rect rgb(240, 240, 240)
        Note over B,AS: Interactive authorization<br/>User interaction required to obtain consent
        B->>IdP: Redirect for user consent
        IdP-->>B: User consents

    end

    AS-->>B: 200 OK (accessToken)

    B->>SW: 9. POST /outgoing-payments
    SW-->>B: 201 Created (outgoingPaymentId)

    B->>SW: 10. GET /outgoing-payments/{outgoingPaymentId}
    SW-->>B: 200 OK

`}
/>

</MermaidWrapper>

The sequence of steps outlined below corresponds to the interactions depicted in the diagram above:

1.  Requests the sender's wallet address
2.  Requests the receiver's wallet address
3.  Requests a grant to create an incoming payment on the receiver's account
4.  Creates an incoming payment on receiver's account
5.  Requests a grant to create and read a quote on the sender's account
6.  Creates a quote on the sender's account
7.  Requests a grant to create and read an outgoing payment on the sender's account

:::note

You have to go through an interaction flow by selecting the `redirect` link in the grant request's response. More information about the interaction flow can be found <LinkOut href ='https://openpayments.dev/identity/grants/'>here</LinkOut>.
:::

8.  Continues the grant request
9.  Creates an outgoing payment on the sender's account
10. Fetches the outgoing payment on the sender's account

#### Admin APIs

In addition to using Rafiki Admin to interact with the Admin APIs, you can also use the Apollo Explorer on `localhost:3001/graphql` and `localhost:4001/graphql` for Cloud Nine Wallet and Happy Life Bank, respectively, and via the [Bruno collection](https://github.com/interledger/rafiki/tree/main/bruno/collections/Rafiki/Rafiki%20Admin%20APIs). The Bruno collection is configured to use the local environment's default endpoints.

#### SPSP

Every wallet address also serves as an SPSP endpoint. A `GET` request with an `Accept` header `application/spsp4+json` will return an SPSP response with STREAM connection details. The following example uses `http://localhost:3000/accounts/gfranklin` as the SPSP endpoint.

```sh wrap
GET http://localhost:3000/accounts/gfranklin HTTP/1.1
Host:backend
Accept:application/spsp4+json

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Connection:keep-alive
Content-Length:220
Content-Type:application/spsp4+json
Date:Thu, 23 Feb 2023 13:07:24 GMT
Keep-Alive:timeout=5

}
```

### Known issues

#### TigerBeetle container exists with code 137

There is a known <LinkOut href='https://docs.tigerbeetle.com/operating/docker/#exited-with-code-137'>issue</LinkOut> when running TigerBeetle in Docker. The container exits without logs and simply shows error code 137. To fix this, increase the Docker memory limit. If you run the local Docker playground on a Windows machine via the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), you can increase the memory limit by <LinkOut href='https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/wsl-config#example-wslconfig-file'>configuring</LinkOut> your `.wslconfig` file.
