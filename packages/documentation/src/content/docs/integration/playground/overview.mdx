The Local Playground provides a suite of packages that, together, mock an account servicing entity that has deployed Rafiki. It exposes an <LinkOut href='https://interledger.org/developers/rfcs/simple-payment-setup-protocol/'>SPSP</LinkOut> endpoint, the [Open Payments APIs](/overview/concepts/open-payments) with its required <LinkOut href='https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-gnap-core-protocol/'>GNAP</LinkOut> auth endpoints to request grants, a STREAM endpoint for receiving Interledger packets, and the Rafiki Admin app to view and manage each Rafiki instance.

This suite of packages includes:

| [`frontend`](/integration/services/frontend-service) | Remix app to expose a UI for Rafiki admin management via interaction with the Backend Admin APIs     |

</div>

These packages depend on the following databases:

<img

  alt='Databases required to run Rafiki'
  style='max-width:300px'
/>

The Local Playground comes with containerized versions of the Rafiki packages and two pre-configured docker-compose files (<LinkOut href="https://github.com/interledger/rafiki/blob/main/localenv/cloud-nine-wallet/docker-compose.yml">Cloud Nine Wallet</LinkOut> and <LinkOut href='https://github.com/interledger/rafiki/blob/main/localenv/happy-life-bank/docker-compose.yml'>Happy Life Bank</LinkOut>) to start two mock account servicing entities with their respective Rafiki `backend` and `auth` servers. They automatically peer, and two to three user accounts are created on both of them.

This environment will set up a playground where you can use the Rafiki Admin APIs and the Open Payments APIs.

:::note

The Mock ASE provided in this repository is intended solely for internal use and demonstration purposes. It is not designed to serve as a reference architecture. If you are looking for a reference implementation of an ASE, please refer to the Test Wallet.
:::

## Running the local environment

To spin up the Local Playground install the following software on your machine:

- A <LinkOut href='https://github.com/interledger/rafiki/blob/main/README.md#environment-setup'>Rafiki local environment setup</LinkOut>
- The <LinkOut href='https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/'>Docker</LinkOut> platform.
- An open-source API client <LinkOut href='https://www.usebruno.com/downloads'>Bruno</LinkOut>

### Setup

Run the following commands from the root of the project.

```sh
## If you have spun up the environment before, first tear down and remove volumes!

pnpm localenv:compose down --volumes

## Otherwise start the local environment
## start the local environment

pnpm localenv:compose up
```

If you want to use Postgres as the accounting database instead of TigerBeetle, you must use the `psql` variant of the `localenv:compose` commands as follows:

```sh
## If you have spun up the environment before, first tear down and remove volumes!
## Otherwise start the local environment
pnpm localenv:compose:psql down --volumes


// start the local environment
pnpm localenv:compose:psql up
```

The local environment consists of a primary and secondary Rafiki instance, each with its docker-compose file (<LinkOut href='https://github.com/interledger/rafiki/blob/main/localenv/cloud-nine-wallet/docker-compose.yml'>Cloud Nine Wallet</LinkOut>, <LinkOut href='https://github.com/interledger/rafiki/blob/main/localenv/cloud-nine-wallet/docker-compose.yml'>Happy Life Bank</LinkOut>). The primary Cloud Nine Wallet docker-compose file (`./cloud-nine-wallet/docker-compose.yml`) includes the primary Rafiki `backend` and `auth` services, as well as the required data stores, which include TigerBeetle (if enabled), Redis, and Postgres. The primary instance contains all of the necessary components so that it can run independently.

The secondary Happy Life Bank docker-compose file (`./happy-life-bank/docker-compose.yml`) includes only the Rafiki services, not the data stores. It uses the data stores created by the primary Rafiki instance, so it can’t be run independently. The `pnpm localenv:compose up` command starts both the primary and secondary instances.

### Environment components

The following components are made available via the Local Playground:

### Rafiki Admin

Manage and view information about the Rafiki instance(s) through the [Rafiki Admin](/admin/admin-user-guide/) application. Rafiki Admin is a Remix app for querying info and executing mutations against the Rafiki [Backend Admin API](https://rafiki.dev/integration/playground/overview#admin-apis).

- Cloud Nine Wallet - http://localhost:3010
- Happy Life Bank - http://localhost:4010

We have secured access to Rafiki Admin using <LinkOut href='https://www.ory.sh/docs/kratos/ory-kratos-intro'>Ory Kratos</LinkOut>; however, in our local playground setup we've chosen to disable user authentication for easier development and testing interactions.

:::note[Enabling Rafiki Admin authentication locally]
If you'd like to enable authentication locally you can run `pnpm localenv:compose:adminauth up`

Separate registrations/users are required for each mock ASE's Admin app as the ASEs are designed to run as separate mock entities. Visit the Rafiki Admin user guide to learn how to [invite](/admin/admin-user-guide#invite-a-user) and [remove](/admin/admin-user-guide#remove-a-user) users via provided scripts.

After you've registered, you can come back to your Rafiki Admin account by navigating to [`localhost:3010`](http://localhost:3010) (Cloud Nine Wallet) or [`localhost:4010`](http://localhost:4010) (Happy Life Bank) and logging in.

Follow these steps to reset a user's Rafiki Admin password.

1. Click the forgot password link and enter an email for a registered user.
2. Open [Mail Slurper](http://localhost:4436/) to access the recovery link for the account.
   :::

### Exploring Accounts on Cloud Nine Wallet

Navigate to [localhost:3030](http://localhost:3030/) to view the accounts on Cloud Nine Wallet.

:::note

The accounts for Happy Life Bank can be found on [localhost:3031](http://localhost:3031/).

:::

Click an account name to view a list of transactions.

### Debugging

Debuggers for the services are exposed on the following ports:

| Services                | IP and Port    |
| ----------------------- | -------------- |
| Cloud Nine Backend      | 127.0.0.1:9229 |
| Cloud Nine Auth         | 127.0.0.1.9230 |
| Happy Life Bank Backend | 127.0.0.1:9231 |
| Happy Life Bank Auth    | 127.0.0.1:9232 |

#### Debugging with a Chromium browser:

1. Go to chrome://inspect
2. Click **Configure** and add the IP addresses and ports detailed above
3. Start the docker containers
4. Click **Inspect** on the service you want to debug to open the Chromium debugger.

You can either trigger the debugger by adding `debugger` statements in the code and restarting the Docker containers or by adding breakpoints directly to the Chromium debugger after starting the Docker containers.

#### Debugging with VS Code:

To debug with VS Code, add this configuration to your `.vscode/launch.json`:

```json
{
    "name": "Attach to docker (cloud-nine-backend)",
    "type": "node",
    "request": "attach",
    "port": 9229,
    "address": "localhost",
    "localRoot": "${workspaceFolder}",
    "remoteRoot": "/home/rafiki/",
    "restart": true
},
```

The `localRoot` variable will depend on the location of the `launch.json` file relative to Rafiki’s root directory.

For more ways to connect debuggers, refer to the <LinkOut href='https://nodejs.org/en/learn/getting-started/debugging'>Node JS docs</LinkOut> for debugging.

### Shutting down

To shut down your local instance, run the following commands:

```sh
# tear down
pnpm localenv:compose down

# tear down and delete database volumes
pnpm localenv:compose down --volumes

# tear down, delete database volumes and remove images
pnpm localenv:compose down --volumes --rmi all
```

### Interacting with the Local Playground

#### Bruno & Open Payments APIs

The Open Payments APIs can be interacted with using the [Bruno collection](https://github.com/interledger/rafiki/tree/main/bruno/collections/Rafiki) ([resource server endpoints](https://github.com/interledger/rafiki/tree/main/bruno/collections/Rafiki/Open%20Payments%20APIs) and [auth server endpoints](https://github.com/interledger/rafiki/tree/main/bruno/collections/Rafiki/Open%20Payments%20Auth%20APIs)).
To interact with the Open Payments APIs using Bruno, you must:

1. load the collection into Bruno by clicking "Open Collection"
2. navigating to `/rafiki/bruno/collections/Rafiki` on your machine and clicking "Open"
3. Furthermore, you need to either load the [Local Environment](https://github.com/interledger/rafiki/tree/main/bruno/collections/Rafiki/environments/Local%20Playground.bru) or the [Remote Test Network Environment](https://github.com/interledger/rafiki/tree/main/bruno/collections/Rafiki/environments/Remote.bru).

The Examples folder in the Bruno collection includes an [Open Payments](https://github.com/interledger/rafiki/tree/main/bruno/collections/Rafiki/Examples/Open%20Payments) example that can be executed in the following sequence:

1.  Requests the sender's wallet address
2.  Requests the receiver's wallet address
3.  Requests a grant to create an incoming payment on the receiver's account
4.  Creates an incoming payment on receiver's account
5.  Requests a grant to create and read a quote on the sender's account
6.  Creates a quote on the sender's account
7.  Requests a grant to create and read an outgoing payment on the sender's account

:::note

You have to go through an interaction flow by clicking on the `redirect` link in the grant request response. More information about the interaction flow can be found <LinkOut href ='https://openpayments.dev/introduction/grants/'>here</LinkOut>.
:::

8.  Continues the grant request
9.  Creates an outgoing payment on the sender's account
10. Fetches the outgoing payment on the sender's account

#### Admin APIs

In addition to using Rafiki Admin to interact with the Admin APIs, you can also use the Apollo Explorer on [localhost:3001/graphql](http://localhost:3001/graphql) and [localhost:4001/graphql](http://localhost:4001/graphql) for Cloud Nine Wallet and Happy Life Bank, respectively, and via the [Bruno collection](https://github.com/interledger/rafiki/tree/main/bruno/collections/Rafiki/Rafiki%20Admin%20APIs). The Bruno collection is configured to use the local environment's default endpoints.

#### SPSP

Every wallet address also serves as an SPSP endpoint. A `GET` request with an `Accept` header `application/spsp4+json` will return an SPSP response with STREAM connection details. The following example uses [http://localhost:3000/accounts/gfranklin](http://localhost:3000/accounts/gfranklin) as the SPSP endpoint.

```sh
http GET http://localhost:3000/accounts/gfranklin Host:backend Accept:application/spsp4+json

Connection:keep-alive
Content-Length:220

```

### Known issues

#### TigerBeetle container exists with code 137

There is a known <LinkOut href='https://docs.tigerbeetle.com/operating/docker/#exited-with-code-137'>issue</LinkOut> when running TigerBeetle in Docker. The container exits without logs and simply shows error code 137. To fix this, increase the Docker memory limit. If you run the local Docker playground on a Windows machine via the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), you can increase the memory limit by <LinkOut href='https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/wsl-config#example-wslconfig-file'>configuring</LinkOut> your `.wslconfig` file.
