title: Auto-Peering with the Test Network
---

import { LinkOut } from '@interledger/docs-design-system'

You can start one local instance of Rafiki and peer it automatically with the remote <LinkOut href='https://wallet.interledger-test.dev/'>Test Network</LinkOut> by running the following commands:

```sh
## using Tigerbeetle DB
pnpm localenv:compose:autopeer
## OR using Postgres DB`
pnpm localenv:compose:psql:autopeer
```

The mock account servicing entity, Cloud Nine Wallet, in your local Rafiki instance will automatically peer with the remote <LinkOut href='https://wallet.interledger-test.dev/'>Test Network</LinkOut> instance. The required services will be exposed externally using the <LinkOut href='https://www.npmjs.com/package/localtunnel'>localtunnel package</LinkOut>.

The exposed ports are:

| Service       | Port |
| ------------- | ---- |
| Open Payments | 3000 |
| ILP connector | 3002 |
| Auth server   | 3006 |

To use the Open Payments example in the <LinkOut href='https://rafiki.dev/integration/playground/overview#bruno--open-payments-apis'>Bruno API collection</LinkOut>, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to <LinkOut href='http://localhost:3030'>localhost:3030</LinkOut> to find the list of created wallet addresses. Alternatively, you can run the following command:

```sh
docker logs rafiki-cloud-nine-mock-ase-1
```

2. Copy the URL of one of the wallet addresses.

3. Set the URL as the `senderWalletAddress` variable in the Bruno Autopeering environment.

:::note
To visit the consent screen for the outgoing payment grant request, you must go through an additional login step by providing your IPv4 address as a tunnel password. You can look up your current IPv4 address by visiting <LinkOut href='https://loca.lt/mytunnelpassword'>
loca.lt/mytunnelpassword</LinkOut> or <LinkOut href='https://www.whatismyip.com/'>whatismyip.com</LinkOut>
:::

To shut down the connection and clear the environment, run the following command:

```sh
pnpm localenv:compose down

## Running the command to shut down is necessary
## as any subsequent script run to spin up a local Rafiki instance
## will use different wallet addresses.
```
