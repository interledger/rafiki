Rafiki’s <LinkOut href="https://github.com/interledger/rafiki/tree/main/packages/frontend">`frontend`</LinkOut> service provides an optional internal admin interface, called the [Rafiki Admin application](/admin/admin-user-guide), for you to manage your Rafiki instance through a <LinkOut href="https://remix.run/">Remix</LinkOut> web app. This service communicates with the [Backend Admin API](/apis/graphql/admin-api-overview#backend-admin-api) to facilitate administrative tasks within Rafiki.

## Requirements

The following are required when using the `frontend` service:

- A Rafiki [`backend`](/integration/services/backend-service) service up and running to access the Backend Admin API.
- An identity provider for authentication and user management. Out of the box, the Rafiki Admin application uses <LinkOut href="https://www.ory.sh/docs/kratos/ory-kratos-intro">Ory Kratos</LinkOut>, a secure and fully open-source identity management solution.

:::danger[Disabling authentication]

Rafiki Admin provides access to sensitive data like peering relationships and wallet addresses. Authentication is enabled by default to restrict access to authorized users only.

In the [Local Playground](/integration/playground/overview#rafiki-admin), authentication is disabled by default to simplify local development and testing. To disable it in other environments, set the environment variable `AUTH_ENABLED` to `false`. This should be done with **extreme caution** and only in specific scenarios:

- Secure, non-production environments like the Local Playground for local development and testing.
- Internal systems where Rafiki Admin is not exposed externally and other access controls (firewalls, local-only access) ensure that the system is secured.

:::

You must also set the environment variables for the `frontend` service.

## Rafiki Admin settings

While the `frontend` service is not required to run a Rafiki instance, it is highly recommended. A number of administrative tasks could be performed programmatically via the Backend Admin API, but the `frontend` service makes these functions available through a user-friendly interface.
