## The Test Network

The [Local Playground](/v1-beta/integration/playground/overview/) is not the only way to test and try out Rafiki. You can also try the Test Network, which is a Rafiki implementation bundled with a wallet and an e-commerce application available online. As it is a test environment, you can experiment integrating with the Interledger network without using real money.

### Applications

The current applications include:

- <LinkOut href='https://boutique.interledger-test.dev/products'>

## Peering with the Test Network

If you have installed the [Local Playground](/v1-beta/integration/playground/overview/) you can peer your local Rafiki instance with the remote Test Network. Refer to the [autopeering](/v1-beta/integration/playground/autopeering/) page for more details.
