:::note[Idempotency key]
You must provide an `idempotencyKey` when calling any mutations related to liquidity. This unique key ensures duplicate or retried requests are processed only once. For more information, see the [Idempotency](/apis/graphql/admin-api-overview#idempotency) section in the GraphQL Admin APIs page.
