# Rafiki Admin

## Development

This project assumes that you have a local Rafiki backend instance up and running. Typically, both `backend` and this project would be used within the local Rafiki playground. See the [local environment setup](../../localenv) for more information on how to set it up.

To start the project in development mode, we first need to generate the GraphQL types for our queries and mutations.

To generate the GraphQL types file run:

```sh
pnpm --filter backend generate
```

To start the application run:

```sh
pnpm --filter frontend dev
```

Now you can access the application on [http://localhost:3005](http://localhost:3005).

> NOTE: When running Rafiki Admin in the development environment, it will connect to Cloud Nine Wallet Admin GraphQL - [http://localhost:3001/graphql](http://localhost:3001/graphql).
