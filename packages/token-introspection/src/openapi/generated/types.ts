             *
             *     When sending a non-continuation request to the AS, the client instance MUST identify itself by including the client field of the request and by signing the request.
             *
             *     Can be either:
             *     - An object with `walletAddress` for wallet-address-based client identification
             *     - An object with `jwk` for directed identity
             *
             *     These are mutually exclusive.
             *
             *     When using the `walletAddress` property:
             *     A JSON Web Key Set document, including the public key that the client instance will use to protect this request and any continuation requests at the AS and any user-facing information about the client instance used in interactions, MUST be available at the wallet address + `/jwks.json` url.
             *
             *     When using the `jwk` property (directed identity approach):
             *     The client instance provides its public key directly in the request, eliminating the need for the AS to fetch it from a wallet address. This approach enhances privacy by not requiring the client to expose a persistent wallet address identifier. The `jwk` property can only be used for non-interactive grant requests (i.e.: incoming payments).
             *
             *     If sending a grant initiation request that requires RO interaction, the wallet address MUST serve necessary client display information.
