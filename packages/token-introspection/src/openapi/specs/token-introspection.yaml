            Wallet address of the client instance that is making this request.

            When sending a non-continuation request to the AS, the client instance MUST identify itself by including the client field of the request and by signing the request.

            A JSON Web Key Set document, including the public key that the client instance will use to protect this request and any continuation requests at the AS and any user-facing information about the client instance used in interactions, MUST be available at the wallet address + `/jwks.json` url.

            If sending a grant initiation request that requires RO interaction, the wallet address MUST serve necessary client display information.
