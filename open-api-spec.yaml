    The Open Payments API is a simple REST API with 4 resource types: **account**, **quote**, **incoming payment** and **outgoing payment**.  

    The *service endpoint* for the API is always the URL of the account resource and all other resources are sub-resources of the account.  

    All resource and collection resource representations use JSON and the media-type `application/json`.  

    The `account` resource has three collections of sub-resources and a single **account holder** sub-resource:   
    1. `/incoming-payments` contains the **incoming payment** sub-resources  
    2. `/outgoing-payments` contains the **outgoing payment** sub-resources  
    3. `/quotes` contains the **quote** sub-resources  

    Access to resources and permission to execute the methods exposed by the API is determined by the grants given to the client represented by an access token used in API requests.
  summary: An API for open access to financial accounts to send and receive payments.

        Retrieve the public information of the account represented by the Payment Pointer.

        This end-point should be open to anonymous requests as it allows clients to verify a Payment Pointer URL and get the basic information required to construct new transactions and discover the grant request URL.

        The content should be slow changing and cacheable for long periods. Servers SHOULD use cache control headers.

      type: object
      description: |-
        All amounts in open payments are represented as a value and an asset code and scale.

        The `value` is an unsigned 64-bit integer amount, represented as a string.

        The `assetCode` is a code that indicates the underlying asset. In most cases this SHOULD be a 3-character ISO 4217 currency code.

        The `assetScale` indicates how the `value` has been scaled relative to the natural scale of the asset. For example, an `value` of `"1234"` with an `assetScale` of `2` represents an amount of 12.34.
      examples:
        - value: '2500'
          assetCode: USD
          assetScale: 2
        - value: '500'
          assetCode: EUR
          assetScale: 2
